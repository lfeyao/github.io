    <p>I'm not a social economist by any means but </p>
<p>I do agree with Graham that I think one thing that both sides can agree on is that it is better for society overall to have a more productive population. would generally agree that to have a higher productive . Sustainable long-term GDP growth is derived from productivity gains. However I don't think that this is achieved by normalizing wage levels by increasing the minimum wage and increasing income tax levels.</p>
<p>One thing I read today that rising income inequality. Constraint optimization problem of time, labor, capital. </p>
<p>I do agree that capital . I don't think that capital deserves a lower tax rate than labor. and don't believe investment . Even though some will regard the double taxation of income then capital as unfair,<br>
You have lawyers / </p>
<p>I find it funny how VCs try to distance themsevles from VC productive lump all of "Wall Street" as an unproductive. While there , there have been plenty of other examples of financing . Just like in tech, people are generally looking for inefficiencies talented And just I'm sure the tech sector has never funded useless projects. At the end of the day, finance is about allocating capital efficiently and regardless of.</p>
<p>I am currently reading Why Nations Fail, extractive vs inclusive institutions</p>
<p>I think a lot of value-added services to society but don't necessarily command a commensurate . As a husband to someone in the medical field, I can . However, I don't think the artificial. Industries that tend to command economic rents should eventually compress. Fields and we are starting to see it in finance as well. </p>
