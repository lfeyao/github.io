    <p>My 3 Goals for 2016:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cook more.</strong> Having lived in NY for 10 years prior to moving to CA, my fridge largely consisted of water and various alcoholic beverages. Since I'm going to be a parent soon, figure it makes sense to start developing this skill which has largely been neglected. The current plan is to try to learn one dish a week. Approximating a ~25% success rate, figure that will give me 10~15 go-to dishes by year-end. If anyone has any tips or advice for best practices, would love to hear them! Particularly interested in inventory management as I think we currently throw out ~50% of the vegetables that we buy right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn more about the pharmaceutical industry and improve my Chinese.</strong> I have been helping Cat's dad as the finance director for his generics pharma business this year so I need to learn more about the field and improve on my Chinese reading and writing comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write more.</strong> This will help to formalize and document my thoughts. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Review of my 3 Goals for 2015:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start a family.</strong> We are having twins in April :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spend more time with family.</strong> Visited my family in Harbin for Chinese New Year and spent a good amount of time with both our parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have fun.</strong> Having a break year before parenthood, I took this year to do some backpacking in Europe, picked up boxing as a hobby, spent a bit more time programming, and took a babymoon vacation with Cat to Croatia.</p>
</li>
