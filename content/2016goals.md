My 3 Goals for 2016:

1. **Cook more.** Having lived in NY for 10 years prior to moving to CA, my fridge largely consisted of water and various alcoholic beverages. Since I'm going to be a parent soon, figure it makes sense to start developing this skill which has largely been neglected. The current plan is to try to learn one dish a week. Approximating a ~25% success rate, figure that will give me 10~15 go-to dishes by year-end. If anyone has any tips or advice for best practices, would love to hear them! Particularly interested in inventory management as I think we currently throw out ~50% of the vegetables that we buy right now.

2. **Learn more about the pharmaceutical industry and improve my Chinese.** I have been helping Cat's dad as the finance director for his generics pharma business this year so I need to learn more about the field and improve on my Chinese reading and writing comprehension.

3. **Write more.** This will help to formalize and document my thoughts. 

Review of my 3 Goals for 2015:

1. **Start a family.** We are having twins in April :)

2. **Spend more time with family.** Visited my family in Harbin for Chinese New Year and spent a good amount of time with both our parents.

3. **Have fun.** Having a break year before parenthood, I took this year to do some backpacking in Europe, picked up boxing as a hobby, spent a bit more time programming, and took a babymoon vacation with Cat to Croatia.
