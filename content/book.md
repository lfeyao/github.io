
Intro
The world is a game, but unlike your board game, it doesn't come with a set of instructions. Below It will be up to you to discover but some frameworks that you can test out. I hope that you will improve upon the thoughts below and pass it along to the next generation.



“Watch your thoughts, they become words;
watch your words, they become actions;
watch your actions, they become habits;
watch your habits, they become character;
watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.”

Accountability
It's not my fault!




Fairness

Ever since there is a sense of fairness. And sometimes that sense of fairness will be challenged. Pout , Reflect

Life isn't fair.  
Since you started playing board games. Sense of fairness. 

Perseverance
Tolerance

Emotions
All emotions serve a purpose.

Happiness



“It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.” 
 Dale Carnegie



Happiness is a mean reverting process. The problem is wanting more.  External vs internal
I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.
Enjoying your job, a craft, or your favorite sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better. Though
most people typically think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money, status, etc.) that
will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we are striving for, we rarely
remain satisfied.19


It is natural that it should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals, but rather by
striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns.20 For example, suppose making a lot of money is
your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it would be foolish to
continue to have making money be your goal. People who acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will
derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, as
with any form of gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing returns, it is only natural that seeking something
new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required to bring us satisfaction.
In other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing
these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary
process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.

Achieving happiness,, the residual effect of 

If . spend more time doing activities correlated with your happiness level.

Sleep, Exercise, Reading

It is a mental state. If , Working out, reading makes me happy. 

Also, for most people happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their expectations
rather than the absolute level of their conditions. 


Sadness
Things will not always go Happiness (Joy) and Sadness are two sides of the same coin. 
Happiness is a mean reverting process. Things that seem like a catastrophic 
It is important to realize that. 



Anger

“Anybody can become angry — that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way — that is not within everybody's power and is not easy.” 
― Aristotle

Love

What is it?

Why does it exist?

Interesting aside. This is a famous problem in computer science known generally as the stopping problem or Secretary problem 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem


In it The problem has an elegant solution. The optimal stopping rule prescribes always rejecting the first n/e applicants after the interview (where e is the base of the natural logarithm) and then stopping at the first applicant who is better than every applicant interviewed so far (or continuing to the last applicant if this never occurs). It is hard to measure best 

Fear

“How much I missed, simply because I was afraid of missing it.” 
― Paulo Coelho, Brida

Just as love can be a great motivating factor. Fear, is the force that holds us back. 


Not all of it is bad. Being a. Does. Flip side. Evaluate the risk appropriately and worry about the probability and the severity of an event. 

Interesting anecdote


Pride

“A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.” 
― C.S. Lewis

Hopefully you will be successful. As you are successful, it is important to not let it get to your head. Hubris, the Greeks wrote about it has always been a source. Inability to acknowledge, blinds the truth .

Systems
The world is a game but unlike your board games, it doesn't For every action there will be a reaction. Before you take a action think about the result of your action. Sometimes it is better to work backwords. Like in chess, if you know a endgame state that you can solve, the bigger problem becomes a of reducing that problem to the point you know you can solve. Balance. 

Think not only about first order consequence but second and third order.



Seeking the truth. Perception vs reality. You have to form your own hypothesis about how the world works. Test it out.

According to Boyd, decision-making occurs in a recurring cycle of observe-orient-decide-act.

Without it. The most important the time value of money. Evaluate how long and how risky these cashflows will be. interesting aside.

Start with a problem. Diagnose it. Dealing with problems are hard.
