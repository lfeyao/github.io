Cat matched to UIC for fellowship next year and the family is moving over to Chicago (target living in the Loop for her work). With a new city comes the same old question: Buy or Rent? Let's look at the pros and cons:

####PROs

+ **Chicago has lagged the recovery.** Below is the Case-Shiller graph of Chicago vs the 20 city composite vs NYC. You can see Chicago has lagged both NYC and the composite. Chicago is only up 34% since 2000 while NYC is up over 80%.

+ **Reasonable rental yields/cap rates.** Scanning across properties in the Loop, it's still possible to get 5% cap rates vs it was hard even finding anything > 3% in NYC. Rents seem to be ~60% of what it costs to live in a similar quality place in NYC so there's some rent appreciation potential there as well vs I don't see how rents can keep going up in NYC.


####CONs

+ **Returns suck.** Real estate returns have lagged S&P equity returns. The main benefit really is in the financing (low long term rates with put optionality). However knowing my general risk-averse nature, I doubt I would use much leverage or take full advantage of the put. If I wanted levered market exposure, I could buy S&P futures with a lower leverage ratio to account for the vol difference and still come out ahead economically. 

+ **Rates.** Fed may raise rates next year which following a line of reasoning may lead to lower house prices. Not too concerned about this as the general correlation of housing prices to rates hasn't been that strong and I think other factors like inventory levels / household formation will dominate over rates.

+ **Convenience.** More things to worry about with owning.

+ **It's cold out there.** Despite favorable economic reasons of living in Chicago vs other cities, doubt Cat wants to live there long term.  

*So on a relative basis, Chicago seems to be a decent city to buy but on an absolute basis my feeling has always been biased towards renting vs buying. With that said, anyone know any good houses/brokers out in Chicago?*
