    <p>My 3 Goals for 2017:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep better in touch with family/friends.</strong> After leaving NY and moving to LA and now CHI, I realized how the circle of people that I actually keep in touch with keeps getting smaller and smaller. I will make more of an effort to reach out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn more about crypto.</strong> I've invested some amount in bitcoin but haven't spent much time with the protocol or other projects like ethereum. I plan to take the Princeton Coursera course and look into this area more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write more.</strong> Simply a repeat since I didn't write much in 2016. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Review of my 3 Goals for 2016:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cook more.</strong> This was largely accomplished in 2016. I now have a rudimentary knowledge of what to buy at the grocery store (always keep garlic, ginger, green onion, and some Chinese vegetables on hand!) and what to put together to create a quick dish. One of my favorite books on cooking was The Food Lab. It was very scientific in its approach and helped me appreciate basic principles. Whereas before I would always just turn the heat to max setting, now I have a greater appreciation for heat at lower temperatures and different tools to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn more about the pharmaceutical industry and improve my Chinese.</strong> This was somewhat accomplished. I spent a fair amount of time learning about the pharma industry but eventually baby duties took over. Same thing with Chinese, checked out a bunch of vocab books but never managed to get through them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write more.</strong> This was a failure. I didn't block off time to write and this blog went ignored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
